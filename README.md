# WebBasics Debugging Simulator – Task 1: Basics of Web Development

**Built by:** Nagam Monika Priya  
**For:** ApexPlanet  

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a clean, modern, responsive single-page UI that demonstrates the basics of web development: HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity. It includes enhanced UX features like a sticky navbar, hover effects, gradient buttons with ripple animation, and accessibility-conscious design.

## ✨ Key Features
- Semantic HTML structure with examples
- Custom CSS variables and responsive layout
- Sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling
- Gradient primary button with ripple effect and accessible focus state
- Inline SVG icons for visual clarity
- Mobile-first responsive behavior
- Footer with quick links and attribution
- JavaScript interactivity: alert button with visual feedback

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure and content
- **CSS3** – styling, variables, responsive grid, effects
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – interactivity (ripple + alert)
- No external dependencies (self-contained)

## 🧰 Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
   ```bash
   # If you want to serve it locally (optional)
   # Using Python (for quick local server)

   # Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser




**Task-2**
# **Task-2** - Contact Us Form with Password Strength Indicator

This project is part of my internship/learning tasks.  
It is a fully responsive **Contact Us Form** created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The form validates user input in real-time and shows the password strength dynamically (Weak, Medium, Strong).

## Features
- **Name Field** – Accepts only valid text input.
- **Email Field** – Checks for proper email format.
- **Password Field** – Minimum 8 characters, shows live strength status.
- **Password Strength Meter** – Changes text and color based on strength.
- **Responsive Design** – Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Client-Side Validation** – No server required.
- **Modern UI** – Clean, minimal, and user-friendly.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Markup structure.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Logic for validation and password strength.

---

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Fill in the form fields to see validation and password strength in action.



## Future Improvements
